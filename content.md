* **Review of Particle Physics (RPP)**
    A comprehensive report on the fields of particle physics and related areas of cosmology and astrophysics, including both review articles and a compilation/evaluation of data on particle properties. The review section includes articles, tables and plots on a wide variety of theoretical and experimental topics of interest to particle physicists and astrophysicists. The particle properties section provides tables of published measurements as well as the Particle Data Groups best values and limits for particle properties such as masses, widths, lifetimes, and branching fractions, and an extensive summary of searches for hypothetical particles. RPP is published as a large book every two years, with partial updates made available once each year on the web.

    All the contents of the book version of RPP are available online: <http://pdg.lbl.gov>

    The printed book can be ordered: <http://pdg.lbl.gov/2017/html/receive_our_products.html>

# Particle Physics Information Platforms {#dbdirorg}

* **INSPIRE:**
    INSPIRE serves as a one-stop information platform for the particle physics community, comprising 8 interlinked databases on literature, conferences, institutions, journals, researchers, experiments, jobs and data. It is run in collaboration by CERN, DESY, Fermilab, IHEP and SLAC, and has been serving the scientific community for almost 50 years. Previously known as SPIRES, it was the first website outside Europe and the first database on the web. Close interaction with the user community and with arXiv, ADS, HepData, ORCID, PDG and publishers is the backbone of INSPIRE's evolution. <http://inspirehep.net/>

    In 2018, INSPIRE is launching a redesigned interface with more efficient searching and filtering. The INSPIRE Labs site is available at: <http://labs.inspirehep.net>

DPHEP, which was initiated as a Study Group in 2008-2009, includes all major HEP experiments and labs and since 2014 has become a Collaboration through the signature of a Collaboration Agreement by a number of large funding agencies.

    Details of the organizational structure, the objectives, workshops and publications can be found on the website.

    The group is endorsed by the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA).

    Regular workshops are organised, status reports are produced and links with similar activities in other disciplines are maintained. <http://dphep.org>

* **REANA:**
    REANA (REusable ANAlyses) is a system for instantiating research data analyses on the cloud using container-based solutions.

* **RECAST:**
    Building on analysis preservation and re-use infrastructure of the LHC experiments, RECAST acts as a science gateway allowing theorists to suggest new reinterpretations of archived analyses of the LHC dataset. Experiments review suggestions and if approved, simulate the proposed models and re-run the archived analysis to determine their viability. Such reinterpretation results are then appended to the records of the original publication in the relevant digital archives.
    Its new website should be available soon at: <http://recast.cern.ch>

Lectures from active scientists give insight in topics and methods of basic research at the fundaments of matter and forces, enabling the students to perform measurements on real data from particle physics experiments themselves. At the end of each day, like in an international research collaboration, the participants join in a video conference for discussion and combination of their results. <http://physicsmasterclasses.org/>

* **LHC physics masterclasses:**
    Lectures from active scientists give insight into methods of basic research, enabling the students to perform measurements on real data from LHC experiments. Like in an international research collaboration, the participants then discuss their results and compare with expectations.
