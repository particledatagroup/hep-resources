# Online Particle Physics Information

Online resources are used in a diverse and expanding set of ways in particle physics.
Many of these resources have become central to our collective work, and we provide a curated
introduction to online resources as part of the [Review of Particle Physics](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2021/reviews/rpp2020-rev-online-hep-info.pdf). That list is, by necessity, incomplete.

By contrast, this repository provides an expanded and regularly updated list of resources. It is meant to be inclusive and catalog all useful resources related to particle physics. The community is warmly invited to contribute in order to ensure a broad and up to date coverage of relevant resources.

:warning: Inclusion of a resource on this list does neither imply endorsement 
by the PDG nor future inclusion in the curated introduction published in 
the Review of Particle Physics.

# How to contribute

# Particle physics information platform

* [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/):
    INSPIRE serves as a one-stop information platform for the particle physics community, comprising interlinked databases on literature, authors, jobs, seminars, conferences, institutions and experiments (each described in more detail below). Run in collaboration by CERN (which hosts INSPIRE), DESY, Fermilab, IHEP, IN2P3 and SLAC, it has been serving the scientific community for almost 50 years. Previously hosted at SLAC and known as SPIRES, it was the first website outside Europe and the first database on the web. Close interaction with the user community and with arXiv, ADS, HEPData, ORCID, PDG and publishers is the backbone of INSPIRE's evolution. Since 2020, it is running on a modernized platform that is continuously being improved.

## Art in Physics

* [Arts@CERN - When Art Meets Science](https://arts.cern):
    Arts at CERN is the leading art and science programme promoting the dialog between artists and particle physicists. Programmes include artistic residencies, art commissions, exhibitions and events.

    The [Collide](https://arts.cern/programme/collide) residency programme aims to develop expert knowledge in the arts through the connection with fundamental science. Since 2011 the COLLIDE award calls to artists to win a fully funded residency for up to 3 months.

    [Connect](https://arts.cern/programme/connect) is a residency program launched in 2021 with the Swiss Arts Council Pro Helvetia. It offers a combined residency: at CERN and at an international location in collaboration with scientific and cultural organizations in Chile, South Africa, and India.

* [Art of Physics Competition](https://www.cap.ca/programs/art-physics/):
    The Canadian Association of Physicists organizes this competition. The first was launched in 1992, with the aim of stimulating interest, especially among non-scientists, in some of the captivating imagery associated with physics. The challenge is to capture photographically a beautiful or unusual physics phenomenon and explain it in less than 200 words in terms that everyone can understand.

* [Fermilab Art Gallery](https://events.fnal.gov/art-gallery/):
    The convergence of art and science occurs daily in the Fermilab Art Gallery open to the public. To initiate and stimulate communication and interactions among scientists, artists and the public, the laboratory hosts an artist-in-residence program. The artist-in-residence interacts with scientists to learn about their research and how it connects to society. They use this information to create
a body of work, leading to presentations in the community and possibly an exhibition of the artwork at Fermilab.

* [TRIUMF Science through Art](https://www.triumf.ca/science-through-art):
    TRIUMF's Science through Art initiatives explore the space where art and science collide. These programs bring artists and TRIUMF researchers, engineers, technicians, tradespeople, and students together to explore new ways of thinking about science, discovery, creativity, and our universe.

## Social Media

Many particle physics institutions and collaborations have a presence on social media, with Facebook, X (Twitter), and Instagram as particularly popular. These resources are typically  used to communicate with the general public, but some of the highlighting of results and communications target physicists as an audience.

## High Energy Physics in developing regions

We attempt to summarize HEP activities and efforts in Africa, Latin 
America and other regions that may be classified and developing or 
emerging. The report is not exhaustive and based on the expert 
knowledge of the authors at the time of information gathering; the 
narrative was developed in July 2023 and would require period 
periodic updates, as the HEP landscape changes. Details may be 
found in arXiv eprint [2308.15373](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15373).
