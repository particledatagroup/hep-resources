# Online Particle Physics Information

Online resources are used in a diverse and expanding set of ways in particle physics.
Many of these resources have become central to our collective work, and we provide a curated
introduction to online resources as part of the [Review of Particle Physics](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2021/reviews/rpp2020-rev-online-hep-info.pdf). That list is, by necessity, incomplete.

By contrast, this repository provides an expanded and regularly updated list of resources. It is meant to be inclusive and catalog all useful resources related to particle physics. The community is warmly invited to contribute in order to ensure a broad and up to date coverage of relevant resources.

:warning: Inclusion of a resource on this list does neither imply endorsement 
by the PDG nor future inclusion in the curated introduction published in 
the Review of Particle Physics.

## Data preservation activities

### Particle physics

* [CERN Analysis Preservation](https://analysispreservation.cern.ch):
    CERN Analysis Preservation is a platform for preserving knowledge and assets of individual physics analyses in LHC collaborations. Its aim is to capture and document all the elements needed to understand and rerun an analysis even several years later: data, software, environment, workflow, context, and documentation. This platform is currently in a pilot stage. It is accessible by LHC experimental groups (standard collaboration access restrictions are applied).

* [DASPOS](https://daspos.crc.nd.edu):
    A collective effort to explore the realisation of a viable data, software and algorithm preservation architecture in High Energy Physics

* [DPHEP](https://dphep.web.cern.ch):
    DPHEP coordinates the efforts to define and implement Data Preservation and Long Term Analysis in HEP. DPHEP, which was initiated as a study group in 2008-2009, includes all major HEP experiments and labs. In 2014, it has become a Collaboration through the signature of a Collaboration Agreement by a number of large funding agencies.
    The group is endorsed by the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA).

    DPHEP regularly organizes workshops, creates status reports, and maintains links with similar activities in other disciplines. Details of the organizational structure, the objectives, workshops and publications can be found on the website.

* [REANA](https://reanahub.io/):
    REANA (REusable ANAlyses) is a system for instantiating research data analyses on the cloud using container-based solutions. It complements CERN Analysis Preservation permitting the reuse and revalidation of preserved analyses. It is being developed in close collaboration with DASPOS and RECAST.

* [RECAST](https://recast.cern.ch):
    Building on analysis preservation and re-use infrastructure of the LHC experiments, RECAST acts as a science gateway allowing theorists to suggest new reinterpretations of archived analyses of the LHC dataset. Experiments review suggestions and, if approved, simulate the proposed models and re-run the archived analysis to determine their viability. Such reinterpretation results are then appended to the records of the original publication in the relevant digital archives.

### Astrophysics

More formal and advanced data preservation activity is ongoing in the field of Experimental Astrophysics, including:

* Fermi Data <https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data>
* IVOA (International Virtual Observatory Alliance) <https://www.ivoa.net/astronomers/applications.html>
